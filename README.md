# Craps
The second station project at TUMO Labs


**Here are the rules of the game:**

The player should roll two dice. If the sum of both of them is 7 or 11 the player wins. If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 (craps) the casino wins. If during the first roll the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, that number becomes the “goal” number. To win, the player should roll the dice till they roll the goal number again. If the player rolls a 7 before rolling the goal number, they lose.
